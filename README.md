# Landing Page Project

I build navbar dynamically with js.

I used Append child, innerHTML.

While you scrolling the section which in the viewport will be active using getboundingclientrect().

When clicking an item from the navigation menu, the link will scroll to the appropriate section using scrollIntoView().

The list item in navbar will active with its section using custom data-nav.

I used media queries to make it responsive.
